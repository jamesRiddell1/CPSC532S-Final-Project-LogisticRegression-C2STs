# CPSC532S-Final-Project-LogisticRegression-C2STs
This repository hosts the code used generate and support the empirical findings of my implementation and exploration of logistic regression based two sample tests.

The jupyter notebook C2ST-LOGREG.ipynb carries out the implementation of a logisitic regression based classifier two sample test modle for exicution and empirical verification on synthetic data.

The CPSC532S_experiments directory contains a modified version of the DK-for-TST repository (https://github.com/fengliu90/DK-for-TST) which was used to test a logits based implementatioin of logisitic regression C2STs in comparision to other nonlinear models.

If you wish to use the code from the DK-for-TST repository please clone from their github and cite their work accordingly. For convienience I have included the citation to work below.
